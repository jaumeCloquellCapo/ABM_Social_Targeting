## Title

Analysis of Innovation Diffusion Processes Based on Consumer Purchase Preferences and Social Relationships

### Description

When a new product is launched, companies often give out free samples to introduce the product in the market. One of the fundamental challenges in viral marketing is to find a small set of seed consumers who can trigger the highest number of adoptions through word-of-mouth (WOM) influence spreading in the network.

Using Agent-Based Models (ABM) and building upon studies that demonstrate faster diffusion when highly connected individuals participate, we propose a new method for selecting seed consumers based on a combination of hubs and agents closest to the product. Subsequently, we will compare the proposed selection method with other seed consumer selection methods (random, hubs, and agents closest to the product) to obtain an optimal answer to which seed consumers and how many of them generate the greatest product diffusion, aiming to increase revenue from viral marketing campaigns while reducing costs.
